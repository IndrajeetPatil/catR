* This is a new release.

* I understand that this is not a typical package, but it has been a helpful
tool for me to deal with pandemic-driven stress and grey, winter weathers. And I
think the global R community will feel the same about using it. (It is similar
to the current CRAN packages like 'cowsay' or 'dadjoke'.)
