# kittyR 0.0.2

  - Due to changes to <https://pixabay.com> and <https://www.pexels.com>,
    `kittyR` function can no longer simply download pictures from these
    websites. So it now instead relies on <https://unsplash.com/> and
    <https://www.reshot.com>.
    
  - `kittyR` now has a logo, thanks to Sarah! :)

# kittyR 0.0.1

  - First version of the package.
