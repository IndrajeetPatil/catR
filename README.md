# catR

This is cat peopleâ€™s version of a package called
[pupR](https://github.com/melissanjohnson/pupR). Instead of doggos, you
will instead get kitties in your R console. ðŸ˜»

You can get the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/)
with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("IndrajeetPatil/catR")
```

And then just execute the only function (`catR`) available.

May these kitties bring some joy and amusement during your stressful
data digging jobs\!

``` r
# to always have the same kitty on README
# choosing a black kitty because they need more love and need to be adopted more
# frequently
set.seed(100)

# show me the kitty NOW!
catR::kittyR()
```
