# kittyR

This is cat peopleâ€™s version of a package called
[pupR](https://github.com/melissanjohnson/pupR). Instead of doggos, you
will get kitties and their adorable meows in your R console. ðŸ˜»

You can get the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/)
with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("IndrajeetPatil/kittyR")
```

And then you can execute one of the two available functions-

In case you want a picture of a kitty:

``` r
# to always have the same kitty on README
# choosing a black kitty because they need more love and need to be adopted more
# frequently
set.seed(100)

# show me the kitty NOW!
kittyR::kittyR()
```

In case you want to hear a meow either *apropos* nothing or at the end
of execution of some code:

``` r
# can't print the sound, so
# meow meow meow
kittyR::meowR()
```

May these kitties bring some joy and amusement during your stressful
data digging jobs\!
