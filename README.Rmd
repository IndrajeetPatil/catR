# kittyR

This is cat people's version of a package called
[pupR](https://github.com/melissanjohnson/pupR). Instead of doggos, you will
instead get kitties in your R console. `r emo::ji("heart_eyes_cat")`

You can get the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("IndrajeetPatil/kittyR")
```

```{r include = FALSE}
library(kittyR)
```

And then just execute the only function (`kittyR`) available.

May these kitties bring some joy and amusement during your stressful data
digging jobs!

```{r kittyR}
# to always have the same kitty on README
# choosing a black kitty because they need more love and need to be adopted more
# frequently
set.seed(100)

# show me the kitty NOW!
kittyR::kittyR()
```
