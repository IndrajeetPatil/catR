This package is designed for rainy days when your results are heartbreaking or
when no matter what you try, you can't seem to get rid of that bug. Take a
respite from those negative thoughts by accessing kitty pictures **and** their
adorable meows right from your R console ðŸ˜» and then get back to work again.

May these kitties bring some joy and amusement during your stressful data
cleaning jobs! ðŸ˜Š

# Installation

The package is available only on `GitHub`:

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("IndrajeetPatil/kittyR")
```

# Functions

There are only two functions in this package-

## `kittyR()`

In case you want a picture of a kitty:

```{r kittyR1}
# to always have the same kitty on README
set.seed(20)

# show me the kitty NOW!
kittyR(meow = FALSE)
```

By default, the collection will include any kind of cat (big, small, wild,
etc.). If you want only kittens, you can use an additional argument.

```{r kittyR2}
# to always have the same kitty on README
set.seed(144)

# show me the kitten NOW!
kittyR(meow = FALSE, only_kitten = TRUE)
```

The collection of cat pictures comes from the following collections of freely
available images:

  - <https://unsplash.com/s/photos/cat/>
  - <https://unsplash.com/s/photos/kitten/>

## `meowR()`

In case you just want to hear a meow either *apropos* nothing or at the end of
execution of some code to let you know that the execution is complete, just
include this line of code:

```{r meowR, eval=FALSE}
# meow meow meow
# you can choose from a sample of six meows
meowR(sound = 4)
```

There are only six meows available at the moment.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
table_html <- function() {
  '<table style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;">
   <thead>
      <tr>
         <th>Sound ID</th>

If you have a kitty meow that you like and would like to include in the package,
please either make a PR or e-mail it to me and I will include it.
